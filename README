USB Controller Gadget kmod

This is a kernel driver intended for a usb device that has 2 interrupt
endpoints, in and out. In my case it is a usb device that controls my
6 sprinkler zones. It creates a character device that udev should 
create for you. If it does not, then you can create it manually. The 
major number is whatever is listed at usb_device under /proc/devices
and the minor is set in the module (31).
